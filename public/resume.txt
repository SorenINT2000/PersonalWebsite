EXPERIENCE
Software Engineer
Magic Sheet Music Incorporated / Musa
July 2022 - Current
- Architect, maintain, and deploy the company's core API using a 3-layer architecture (Python, FastAPI, SQLModel); designed and secured the AWS stack (ECS, RDS, S3, ALB, Cognito), managing secrets with SSM Parameter Store and secure dev access with an SSH bastion host.
- Engineered a multi-threaded Python batch uploader (with a Textual TUI) to process, convert, and ingest 1.2 million (500GB) sheet music files into the API, featuring concurrent processing, queue management, and job-resume capabilities.
- Developed a secure, cross-platform internal admin application (Electron, TypeScript, React, MUI) to manage the API database, run web-scraping jobs, and automatically synchronize files with live MuseScore sessions.
- Lead development of the public-facing marketing website and user portal (React, TypeScript, Vite), featuring role-based dashboards (Learner & Teacher) with distinct permissions, billing, and student management UIs.
- Implemented comprehensive testing and CI/CD, achieving 75% code coverage with Pytest on the backend API and automating deployments to AWS ECS using GitLab CI.

Undergraduate Teaching Assistant
CWRU - Compiler Design
Fall 2022 & 2023
- Co-authored a new LLVM tutorial series (slides + code + write-ups) that replaces the steep llvm.org guide, letting first-time compiler students build and extend a mini-compiler with minimal prior background.
- Wrote detailed design documents and sample solutions for six lab assignments, covering lexical analysis with Flex, parsing with Bison, and LLVM IR generation & optimization passes.
- Delivered 3 guest lectures: "Intro to Programming in C++," "Object-Oriented Programming in C++," and "Introduction to Flex."
- Hosted weekly Zoom office hours and Slack Q&A, mentoring ≈30 students per term on debugging clang errors, interpreting IR, and structuring compiler pipelines.
- Collaborated with two fellow TAs & Department Chair to align grading rubrics and maintain consistent feedback across project milestones.

PROJECTS
WebRTC Videochat
TypeScript, React, Firebase Realtime DB, WebRTC, Metered TURN Server, Chakra UI
A WebRTC videochat web-app that uses Firebase Realtime Database as a signaling server and the WebRTC protocol to stream video and audio data between clients. Uses Metered TURN server to relay traffic between clients and Firebase Security Rules to secure the database.

Mockup Nonprofit Website
TypeScript, React, Firebase Auth, Firestore DB, Storage & Functions, Mantine UI
A website mockup for a physician nonprofit association. Complete with an auth-protected admin dashboard where committee chairs can make announcements and executive members can manage permissions. Uses server-side pagination to load announcements and Firebase Functions to securely manage user claims.

Variational Quantum Circuit for K-arm Bandit Solution Opt
Python, Numpy, Matplotlib, Qiskit
Uses a simulated VQC to optimize a solution to K-arm bandit problems. Shown to provide a general improvement in accuracy of the final solution over a classical epsilon-greedy approach for large K.

Malware Image Classification with ESRGAN
Python, Numpy, SkLearn, Pytorch
Combines a baseline CNN with a pre-trained ESRGAN model to improve the accuracy of classification of malware images by ~6%. Uses the MalIMG dataset to train the CNN and connective network, keeping the ESRGAN model frozen.

LLM Knowledge Graph Extraction & Bias Detection
Python, Neo4j, LLMs, Ollama
Uses an LLM to extract knowledge graphs from reddit posts to build bipartite knowledge graphs between groups of people and trait nodes. Uses an Ollama sentence transformer to detect social biases in the text between two parametrized groups by analyzing the knowledge graph.
